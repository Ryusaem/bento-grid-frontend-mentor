### What I learned

1. I tried to build the desktop view with grid-template columns and grid-template-rows.
   Using "grid-template-rows" with value like "repeat(4, 1fr)" was a mistake because my content grow too big and took so much space vertically. It was ugly.
   By not setting any grid-template-rows, everything worked.
   I had this revelation thanks to Chat GPT.
